# Demo for the github Action of CryptoAnalysis - executed on CamBench
This repository is a demo on how to integrate the on github Action of [CryptoAnalysis](https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/CryptoAnalysis) into a reposity.
This demo is performed on [CamBench](https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/CamBench) as it provides labeled examples of cryptographic API misuses and correct usages in [CamBench_Cap](https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/CamBench/tree/main/CamBench_Cap)
The github action is configured in [cognicrypt.yml](https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/CryptoAnalysis-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/cognicrypt.yml) and executed in [pull requests](https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/CryptoAnalysis-demo/pull/1). More detailed results can be seen in the [workflow's summary](https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/CryptoAnalysis-demo/actions/runs/8359083312).



# CamBench - Cryptographic API Misuse Detection Tool Benchmark

![](./logos/CamBench.png)

CamBench envisions to be a comprehensive benchmark for cryptographic API misuse detection tools consisting of three components: 
- CamBench_Real includes real-world Java applications with manually labeled usages. 
- CamBench_Cap includes synthetic test cases to cover analysis capabilities.
- CamBench_Cov is a heuristic for crypto API coverage. 

CamBench is accepted as [a registered report at MSR 22](https://conf.researchr.org/track/msr-2022/msr-2022-registered-reports?#event-overview) [^1].
